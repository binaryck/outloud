# Privacy Policy for OutLoud Chrome Extension

**Last Updated: August 12, 2025**

## Overview

OutLoud is a Chrome extension that helps users archive their social media posts using decentralized storage technology. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.

## Information We Collect

### Data Collected Locally
- **Social Media Posts**: When you click "Repost on Bitcoin" on your own posts, we temporarily store the post content (text, author, timestamp) locally in your browser
- **Receiver Addresses**: Bitcoin addresses you enter for receiving inscriptions
- **Extension Settings**: Your preferences and wallet detection states

### Data We Do NOT Collect
- We do not collect personal information
- We do not track your browsing activity
- We do not store data on external servers beyond the inscription service
- We do not access posts you haven't explicitly selected
- We do not collect passwords, private keys, or sensitive wallet information

## How We Use Information

### Local Processing
- Post data is processed locally in your browser
- Data is only sent to the inscription service when you explicitly choose to inscribe a post
- Temporary storage is used only to transfer data between the webpage and extension popup

### Third-Party Services
- **OrdinalsBot**: We use OrdinalsBot service to create Bitcoin inscriptions when you choose to archive a post
- **Wallet Providers**: We detect and interact with XVerse and Unisat wallets (if installed) to facilitate payments

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
- All data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's secure storage API
- Data is automatically cleared when you uninstall the extension
- No data is synchronized across devices unless you explicitly enable Chrome sync

### Data Transmission
- Post data is only transmitted when you explicitly click "inscribe"
- All communications use secure HTTPS connections
- We do not store or cache your data on external servers

## Your Rights and Controls

### What You Can Do
- **View Data**: All stored data is accessible through Chrome's extension management
- **Delete Data**: Uninstalling the extension removes all stored data
- **Control Usage**: You choose which posts to archive - the extension only processes posts you explicitly select

### Permissions Explained
- **activeTab**: Allows us to detect your posts and add the "Repost on Bitcoin" button only on X.com
- **storage**: Stores your selected posts temporarily and extension preferences locally
- **scripting**: Enables the extension to add the archive button to your posts on X.com

## Third-Party Integration

### X.com (Twitter)
- We only access content from posts you explicitly select
- We do not read your timeline, messages, or other users' content
- The extension only activates on X.com/Twitter.com

### Wallet Integration
- We detect installed Bitcoin wallets (XVerse, Unisat) to facilitate payments
- We do not access your wallet data, private keys, or transaction history
- All wallet interactions require your explicit approval

## Data Retention

- **Selected Posts**: Stored temporarily until inscription is complete or extension is closed
- **Settings**: Stored until you change them or uninstall the extension
- **No Long-term Storage**: We do not maintain long-term databases of user data

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy as needed. The "Last Updated" date will reflect any changes. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
